# The role of relational (SQL) and Non-Relational (NoSQL) databases in the Data Engineer's context

Deciding which is the best modern database is the biggest challenge for those who build systemic solutions.

A relational or non-relational data structure are viable options. However we must keep in mind there are critical differences between the two. 

SQL databases are relational and NoSQL databases are non-relational.
Using structured query language the SQL databases have a predefined schema, while NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. 
When we think of scalability, SQL databases are vertical, while NO-SQL databases are horizontal.

SQL databases are table-based and better for multi-row transactions. NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON and are document, key-value, wide-column stores and graph-based.

Choosing SQL or NO-SQL will always have advantages and disadvantages that we must take into account.

ACID compliance and ideal for consistent data systems are advantages that make SQL stand out, in addition better support options because RDBMS databases have been around for over 40 years. On the other hand, scalability challenges and difficulties with sharding and less efficient with NoSQL formats are downsides of SQL.

The most popular SQL database is Oracle and we have MySQL and Microsoft SQL server rounded out the top three.
  
Excellent for handling "big data" analytics, no limits on types of data you can store and easier to scale are advantages we can list for NO-SQL. The disadvantages are lack of tools, compatibility, standardization challenges and more difficult to find support.

MongoDB and Appache Cassandra are the most popular NO-SQL databases, in addition we also have Neo4j, Redis, OrientDB, Riak, RavenDB and Hypertable.
